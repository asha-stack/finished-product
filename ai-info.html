							<h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
							<p>
              Artificial intelligence is the name given to any computer 
              system taught to mimic intelligence human behaviours.
							</p>
							<p>
                It referes to anything from programs taught how to play board games and translate
                languages, to complex systems that can have human sounding conversations, analyse
                the stock market or help to diagnose health condition           
              </p>

              <h2>AI is powering practical tools that exist all around us.</h2>
              <p>
                  These technologies already show up in everyday life-helping to organise photos 
                  on our smartphones or plan a journey to work. They take tasks that have historically required 
                  considerable human intellect and work through then using computer programming.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last decade has seen major progress, sparked by increasing computer speeds and the introduction
                of techniques such as machine learning. As a result, AI is now becoming increasingly woven into the 
                way we live, work and make sense of the world.
